## Welcome to Single source of truth !! I mean Software Engineering (correction: Web development) topics.

This website should grow and would grow. Make sure you [fork me !](https://github.com/tagpro/sw-topics/) and ignore all the grammatical mistakes. 

I am using an outdated but easy-to-build website builder : JEKYLL. Forgive me if you think there is something better out there. You can make this more pretty if you think that would make this world a better place.

BTW, before you start reading this, a note about climate change. Please go watch the documentary: [Before the flood](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80141928) and feel bad for our planet and may be contribute to sustain this planet and it's future. #climatechange
